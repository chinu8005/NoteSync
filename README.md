# NoteSync

The credit-based note system is a popular approach to encourage students to actively engage in their studies. However, it can be challenging for students to keep track of their notes, especially when they have multiple classes with different credit systems. To address this problem, a new app has been developed that synchronizes all notes for each student in one central location, making it easy for them to access their notes from any device. This app not only saves students time but also ensures that they never miss any important information or notes. With this innovative solution, students can focus more on their studies and less on organizing their notes, leading to better academic outcomes.

The proposed platform will leverage cloud computing technology to ensure scalability, reliability, and accessibility. It will provide users with a user-friendly and intuitive interface that allows them to upload, download, and rate notes with ease. Additionally, the platform will incorporate advanced search and filtering capabilities that enable users to find notes that best match their needs and interests.
